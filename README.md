# 3D_Render

Small demo project containing a basic 3D rendering example using vanilla JS.

## Files

- `index.html` — HTML entry point.
- `index.js` — Main JavaScript file that initializes the 3D rendering.

## Run

The simplest way to run the project is to open `index.html` in a browser. For a local HTTP server (recommended), run one of the following from the project root:

Python 3:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Node (http-server):

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server -c-1 . 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Notes

- This repository currently contains only the minimal demo files. Add assets, examples, or build tooling as needed.
- Suggested next steps: add a `LICENSE`, usage examples, or a `package.json` with a `start` script.
